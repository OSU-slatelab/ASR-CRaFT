This code is not yet ready for a source-code distribution, which means
that if you want to build it, you should follow the "developer" instructions
below.

TBD. This should eventually say something to the effect of, go get the
distro and run `./configure && make && make install`.

FOR DEVELOPERS
================

This package has been built using autoconf version 2.68 (or higher) and
automake version 1.15. You may be able to build it with older software, but
it may take some coaxing. Some m4 macros were undefined when attempting to
build using automake version 1.11, for example.

Dependencies:
ASR-CRaFT statically compiles dependencies into a library and executables.
It requires the QuickNet3 library ([TODO: insert link here]), CBLAS (for
example, via ATLAS [link]), and OpenFST ([link]) to build. If these libraries
and headers are installed in non-standard locations, you may need to supply
relevant flags to the configure script (e.g. ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/
quicknet3/library -L/path/to/openfst/library" CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/quicknet3/
headers -I/path/to/openfst/headers").

To build:
Ideally, you should be able to:
1. Clone the source
2. Run `autoreconf` in the top-level directory
   (you may need to run `automake --add-missing` first).
3. Run `./configure`
   (see above about non-standard library and header locations; also, the
   .gitignore file is set up to allow a parallel build from a ./build/
   directory. If you want to keep your source tree free of object files,
   you may want to create the build/ directory, and from build/, run
   `../configure <options>`).
4. Run `make`.

Installation (via `make install`) isn't working yet.
